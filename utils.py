        PharmKG stands for Pharmaceutical Knowledge Graph, which is a database that represents the relationships between various entities in the biomedical and pharmaceutical fields, such as drugs, diseases, proteins, and genes, in a structured manner.
        Key features and uses of PharmKG include:
        Data Integration: Integrates information from various biomedical databases.
        Relationship Representation: Represents complex relationships such as drug-disease, drug-protein, and drug-side effect in a graph form.
        Drug Development Support: Used in research for discovering new drug targets and drug repurposing.
        Adverse Effect Prediction: Can be used to predict drug-drug interactions or potential adverse effects.
        Personalized Medicine: Helps analyze the relationship between patients' genetic characteristics and drug responses.
        AI Research: Used to train machine learning models, contributing to the discovery of new biomedical knowledge.
        Decision Support: Provides comprehensive information that medical professionals can use when developing patient treatment plans.
        PharmKG systematically organizes and analyzes complex drug-related information, making it an important tool in pharmaceutical research and clinical decision-making.
