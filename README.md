# Pharma-AI

## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging AI to revolutionize pharma. It involves developing a drug discovery and development system that recommends promising drug candidates based on disease input prompts, using vast biomedical datasets to enhance accuracy. Additionally, it incorporates predictive modeling and generative AI for novel compound design and toxicity assessment, providing efficient and targeted therapeutic solutions to improve patient outcomes.

## Features
Drug Discovery: Faster target ID, novel molecule design, drug repurposing.
Clinical Trials: Optimized design, patient recruitment, real-time monitoring, outcome prediction.
Manufacturing: Process optimization, predictive maintenance, quality control, supply chain efficiency.
Personalized Medicine: Tailored treatments, disease risk assessment.
Pharmacovigilance: Enhanced adverse event detection and management.
